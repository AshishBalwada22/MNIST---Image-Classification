# MNIST---Image-Classification
Using Tensorflow and CNN(Convolutional Neural Network). Given - MNIST dataset consists of 55,000 training images and 10,000 testing images.The architecture consists of two convolutional layers along with the two pooling layers . At the end we are passing the data through the single dense layer to produce the accuracy of 98.76.
